You can set up one reserve unit in the Celestial Realm for each unit you have set up on the battlefield. At the end of your movement phase, you can set up one or more of the reserve units in the Celestial Realm on the battlefield, more than 9\" from any enemy units. Any reserve units in the Celestial Realm that are not set up on the battlefield before the start of the fourth battle round are slain."
